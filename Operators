Python operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and value.

e.g = print(10 + 5)

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operation

+, - , *, /, %, // - floor division, ** = exponential
—————————
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
x = 5,
x += 3
x -= 3
x*= 3
x /= 3
x %= 3
x //= 3
x **= 3

——————————
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

x == y
x != y
x > y
x >= y
x <y
x <= y

——————————
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements


x <5 and x <10 
x <5 or x <10 
not(x <5 and x <10 )

—————————
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

 
In :- 
Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object

x = ["apple", "banana"]

print("banana" in x)

not in :- 
Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object


x = ["apple", "banana"]

print("banana" not in x)
